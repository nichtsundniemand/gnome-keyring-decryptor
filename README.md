# gnome-keyring-decryptor

This repository contains a simple utility to decode and decrypt the `.keystore`-files
used by the `gnome-keyring` utility and daemon.

The decrypted keystore's contents are then output in JSON format.

I am really surprised this didn't exist. There is a keyring-dump utility in the
`gnome-keyring`-repo, but since the output-format of that utility is not really suitable
for further processing, I decided to create this tool.

## Usage

TBD.
