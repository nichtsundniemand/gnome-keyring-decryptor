# gnome-keyring-decryptor

This repository contains a simple utility to decode and decrypt the `.keystore`-files
used by the `gnome-keyring` utility and daemon.

The decrypted keystore's contents are then output in JSON format.

I am really surprised this didn't exist. There is a keyring-dump utility in the
`gnome-keyring`-repo, but since the output-format of that utility is not really suitable
for further processing, I decided to create this tool.

## Building & Hacking

This project is built using [`meson`](https://mesonbuild.com/), so you will need that.
In order to use `meson` you will also need a build-backend. I simply use [`ninja`](https://ninja-build.org/)
which is the default.

The provided `nix`-flake will yield a dev-environment containing all the necessary
dependencies, so using it is recommended.

Since this project also includes an `.envrc` using [`nix-direnv`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv)
for use with the provided flake, I strongly recommend setting up [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/)
as well.

Build depencies:
 * [`docopt.c`](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.c): For generating the argument parser
   in accordance with the [`docopt`](http://docopt.org/)-specification.

   Meson needs to be able to find this in your Python's search-path.
 * [`cmocka`](https://cmocka.org/): Test-framework used by the unit-tests.

   This should be available through most distribution's repositories. Meson needs to
   be able to find this as a dependency.

To build this project simply follow the usual `meson`-procedure:
```sh
$ meson setuo build
$ ninja -C build
```

Afterwards, if everything went well, the executable can be found under `build/gnome-keyring-decryptor`.

## Usage

To use this tool simply call `gnome-keyring-decryptor --keyring=<file>` with `<file>`
being the path to the keyring-file on the command line.

The contents of the keyring will then be output on `stdout`.

## References

 * The file format is documented in the `gnome-keyring`-repository under
   [`docs/file-format.txt`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-keyring/-/blob/master/docs/file-format.txt).

   A copy of that file can be found in this repository - also under `docs/file-format.txt` -
   in case the upstream version gets removed or moved in any way.
 * This tool is - in general - inspired by/copied from the aforementioned tool in the
   `gnome-keyring`-repo:
   [dump-keyring0-format.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-keyring/-/blob/master/pkcs11/secret-store/dump-keyring0-format.c)
